# Data Structures Tutorial

Welcome to the Data Structures Tutorial. Every medium Python programmer should understand these basic topics:

- [Stacks](1-stacks.md)
- [Sets](2-sets.md)
- [Trees](3-trees.md)

Each module will contain descriptions and examples. At the end of each module, you will find a problem to solve on your own. You should only look at the solution after you have attempted to solve the problem first.
